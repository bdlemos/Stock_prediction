**Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Network**

This repository contains code for predicting the open value of stocks using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like time series forecasting.

**Overview**

In this project, we utilize historical stock price data to train an LSTM model to predict the open value of a stock for a given day. The LSTM model learns patterns and dependencies in the historical data to make predictions about future stock prices.
There are two notebooks, in one of them only previous open price are used to predict, in the other one the close price are also used and the results of predictions were better.
